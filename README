Doodle-js - An Animation Library for JavaScript

Tested on Chrome, looking good on Firefox 4.
Requires a browser with support for HTML5 Canvas and some ECMAScript 5 capabilities.

Some of the features:
  * Use the Canvas drawing API with sprites and a scene graph.
  * Event handling and dispatch for objects.
  * Nodes maintain transforms, bounds, and other useful properties.
  * If you're coming from ActionScript 3, you'll feel right at home!

Basic build instructions:
  git clone git://github.com/billyist/doodle-js.git
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  ./build/make-doodle => ./build/doodle.js

Debugging version (some useful error messages):
  ./build/make-doodle -D => ./build/doodle-debug.js

For more options: ./build/make-doodle -h
