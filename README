Doodle-js v0.2

Completely rewritten using ES5 features available in newer
JavaScript engines. Version 0.1 still runs on JS2 and is
located in the downloads section as a source archive.

Some of the new features:
  * Supports multiple displays, each containing multiple layers.
  * Added a scene graph.
  * Has a new event handling system for Doodle objects.
  * Bounding Box for sprites.

Some features work, some don't.
