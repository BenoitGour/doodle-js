Doodle-js - An Animation Library for JavaScript

Testing on Chrome, marginal success on Firefox 4.
Requires a browser with some ECMAScript 5 capabilities.

Some of the features:
  * Use the Canvas drawing API with sprites and a scene graph.
  * Event handling and dispatch for objects.
  * Nodes maintain transforms, bounds, and other useful properties.
  * If you're coming from ActionScript 3, you'll feel right at home!
